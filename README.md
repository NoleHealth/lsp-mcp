## Decisions
* Using python - I want to leverage a client library that makes the startup of this simple. A lot of LSPs are created in node, but the mature client libraries seem to be dependent on vscode. I like the look of this library, so we'll start with python: https://github.com/microsoft/multilspy. It helps that I already created a python MCP, so at least I'll have a leg up there
